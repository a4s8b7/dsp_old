Changes from 0.50 to 0.50:                                
    Initial release. Supports writing a series of BMP 
    image files (at any bit depth) to an AVI movie file.
    Tested on g++, Intel's icc, mingw, Borland 5.0, and MS
    Visual Studio 2005. 
    
    Big-endian (e.g., PowerPC) currently unsupported, but
    will be soon.
    
    Help function incomplete, but coming soon.

Changes from 0.50 to 0.51:
    Improved aesthetics of initial title screen.

    Fixed the suggested buffer size in strh and avih to 
    the proper size, so that an entire frame is included 
    in the buffer (including the padding to make rows 
    align on 4 byte boundaries). This will improve video 
    playback performance, especially on large AVI output 
    files. 
    
    Set dwMaxBytesPerSecond in avih to zero to improve 
    video playback performance on output AVI files. Evi-
    dently, everybody does this. 

    Removed a stupid comment (originated from Daily Show) 
    in the HandleFlag() function.
    
    Added support for setting copyright bit. This is prob-
    ably useless, but may not hurt for those distributing
    AVI files over the net. 
    
    Fixed bugs in writing the strh where the width and 
    height weren't properly noted in the data structure. 
    This was the last warning given by AVIMaster.
    
    Added WriteWORD() function to write the occasional 
    WORD, particularly in the strh data structure. 
    
    Filled in the DisplayHelp() function, which is acti-
    vated by the -help flag.
    
*--------------------------------------------------------*
Date: 5-24-2006
Changes from 0.51 to 0.52:    
    Added functions WriteBufferToFile() and 
    ReadFileToBuffer() for better disk access performance.
    These may be used more in the future. 
    
    Added function InvertBufferOrder() to reverse the byte
    order of any multi-byte data structure. We may use 
    this for big-endian support, but it's currently not 
    needed. 

    Rewrote WriteWORD() to be endian-safe.
    
    Rewrote WriteDWORD() to be endian-safe.

    Verified that WriteString() is endian-safe.
    
    Rewrote WriteChunk() to be endian-safe. Currently, 
    this function is not used. 
    
    Removed the MainAVIHeader data structure, since it 
    didn't cooperate well with easy byte reversal. (Needed
    to do it in chunks of 4 bytes, and was more trouble 
    than it's worth.)
    
    Added WriteAVIH() and WriteBMIH() functions that are 
    endian-safe and neater. 
    
    Double-checked that WriteSTRH() is endian-safe. 
    
    Cleaned up WriteFrame() and made sure it is endian-
    safe.

    Verified that new version of EasyBMPtoAVI is endian-
    safe on Sun Sparc4 machine running Solaris. 
    
    Added function DetermineFrameDataSize() to automate 
    finding the size of a single data frame (biSizeImage),
    which is used several times in the program. 
    
    Added check of the maximum file size, with an error 
    message if above 2 GB and program termination. 
    
    Added a check to see if the output file file could be 
    opened for reading. An error message is generated if 
    not, with program termination. 
    
    Cleaned up message that indicates when the copyright 
    bit will be set.

    Added sample CFLAGS option to makefile for compling 
    with Intel's icc on a pentium 4. 

    Added further clarifications to the makefile 

*--------------------------------------------------------*
Date: 5-31-2006
Changes from 0.52 to 0.53:    
    Made EasyBMPtoAVI compatible with EasyBMP version 1.02
    and up.
    
    Added macros to continue compatibility with earlier 
    versions of EasyBMP.

    Compiling with EasyBMP 1.02 or later should ensure im-
    proved performance (buffered reading of BMP images), 
    as well as better compatibility with 64-bit machines. 

*--------------------------------------------------------*
Date: 8-10-2006
Changes from 0.53 to 0.54:
    Changed code to allow for non-integral framerates 
    (e.g., 29.97).
    
    Added new "smooth" flag that (temporaly) smooths the 
    output by interpolating frames. A smoothing factor of
    N multiplies the framerate by a factor of N, i.e., in-
    serts (N-1) interpolated frames between every two or-
    iginal frames. 
    
    Introduced an experimental function to interleave 
    frames rather than interpolate them. This should be 
    faster than interpolation. You can invoke this option
    with the "interleave" flag. 

    Did some code cleanup. 
    
    Updated the help function. 
    
    Fixed the bug where the first and last frame numbers 
    were displayed in the option summary when in fact a 
    file list was used. 

    Added copyright bit, smoothing factor, and interleave
    options to the option summary display at the start of
    the program.
    
*--------------------------------------------------------*
Date: 11-12-2006
Changes from 0.54 to 0.55:
    Updated to make use of EasyBMP Version 1.05.
    
    Added new flag (-increment N) to allow the filenames 
    to increment by N, rather than 1.
    
    Added new flag (-rescale <mode><size>) to rescale the 
    input images as below:
-rescale p300   Rescales images to 300% of original size
-rescale w300   Rescales proportionally to new width 300
-rescale h300   Rescales proportionally to new height 300
-rescale f300   Rescales to fit inside a 300 x 300 square.

    Changed the makefile to better handle optimizations.
